# Wave Energy vs Morison Force Approach

This repository contains a short technical note clarifying why
wave energy concepts are not appropriate for assessing wave-induced
loads on vertical piles.

The note compares:
- an energy-flux-based interpretation
- a force-based hydrodynamic interpretation using Morison’s equation

The document is written as a theory-focused technical note
and is intended for coastal and offshore engineers.
