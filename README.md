# Coastal & Offshore Engineering Notes

# Wave Energy vs Morison Force Approach

This repository hosts a curated set of technical notes focused on **fundamental theory** and **modern engineering practice** in coastal and offshore engineering.

The material is developed with primary reference to classical sources such as Sorensen’s *Coastal Engineering* and the USACE *Shore Protection Manual / Coastal Engineering Manual*, and is extended to reflect contemporary offshore engineering practice.

The intent is to clarify first principles, common misconceptions, and practical interpretations relevant to engineers working with waves, currents, and marine structures.

This repository contains a short theory-focused technical note examining why wave energy concepts are not applicable to the assessment of wave-induced loads on vertical piles.
